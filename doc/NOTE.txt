GARLI Version 1.0

Please note that I will no longer be updating the manual document, 
which was up to date through version 0.96b8.  There have been only
a few functional changes between 0.96 and 1.0, so the manual may 
still be helpful.

All documentation available in the manual, plus much more, is 
available on the GARLI support Wiki at 
http://www.nescent.org/wg_garli/Main_Page

It is much easier and more efficient to add to, maintain and correct
the wiki, so it will be the source for future documentation as well 
as news, updates, etc.
