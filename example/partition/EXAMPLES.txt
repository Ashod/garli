Included here are template config files and example analysis results for partitioned
analyses.

Looking at the .screen.log files in the example runs (especially the end) will
give you a feeling for what the program is estimating and what the results
will consist of.

For the template config files, "large data" generally refers to alignments with
more than about 50 sequences.  

Note that to use the template configs you'd still need to specify the partitioning 
of your data, which is done in the nexus file containing your alignment (sorry, 
nexus format required for this).  See this page for help on doing this:

or look at the datafiles in the example runs directory.
