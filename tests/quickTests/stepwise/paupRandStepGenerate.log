        This is a beta-test version.  Please report any crashes,
        apparent calculation errors, or other anomalous results.
        There are no restrictions on publication of results obtained
        with this version, but you should check the WWW site
        frequently for bug announcements and/or updated versions.

Optimality criterion set to likelihood.

Heuristic search settings:
  Optimality criterion = likelihood
    Likelihood settings:
      Number of substitution types  = 1
      Assumed nucleotide frequencies (set by user):
        A=0.25000  C=0.25000  G=0.25000  T=0.25000
      Among-site rate variation:
        Assumed proportion of invariable sites  = none
        Distribution of rates at variable sites = equal
      These settings correspond to the JC69 model
      Number of distinct data patterns under this model = 100
      Molecular clock not enforced
      Starting branch lengths obtained using Rogers-Swofford approximation method
      Trees with approximate likelihoods 5% or further from the target score are rejected without additional
        iteration
      Branch-length optimization = one-dimensional Newton-Raphson with pass limit=20, delta=1e-006
      -ln L (unconstrained) = unavailable due to missing-data and/or ambiguities
  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
  Addition sequence: random
    Number of replicates = 1000
    Starting seed = 1783464443
    Saving optimal trees from each replicate, even if they are not optimal overall
  Number of trees held at each step during stepwise addition = 1
  Branch-swapping algorithm: none
  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if branch length is less than or equal to 1e-008
  Topological constraints not enforced
  Trees are unrooted

   Total number of rearrangements tried = 0
