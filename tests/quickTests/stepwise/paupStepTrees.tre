>  Optimality criterion = likelihood
>    Likelihood settings:
>      Assumed nucleotide frequencies (set by user):
>        A=0.25000  C=0.25000  G=0.25000  T=0.25000
>      Among-site rate variation:
>        Assumed proportion of invariable sites  = none
>        Distribution of rates at variable sites = equal
>      These settings correspond to the JC69 model
>      Number of distinct data patterns under this model = 100
>      Molecular clock not enforced
>      Starting branch lengths obtained using Rogers-Swofford approximation method
>      Trees with approximate likelihoods 5% or further from the target score are rejected without additional
>        iteration
>      Branch-length optimization = one-dimensional Newton-Raphson with pass limit=20, delta=1e-006
>      -ln L (unconstrained) = unavailable due to missing-data and/or ambiguities
>  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
>  Addition sequence: random
>    Number of replicates = 1000
>    Starting seed = 1783464443
>    Saving optimal trees from each replicate, even if they are not optimal overall
>  Number of trees held at each step during stepwise addition = 1
>  Branch-swapping algorithm: none
>  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if branch length is less than or equal to 1e-008
>  Topological constraints not enforced
>  Trees are unrooted

>Heuristic search completed
